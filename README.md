# Analysis of job ads for _Data Scientist_ roles from job boards

In this project I am scraping job ads contents from a popular job board to gather insights on the key skills listed and other factors. The project is structured as follows:

- **Job ads scraping** notebook: scraping of job descriptions and other information (salary, location, type of contract), saved in a JSON format for ease of reading and manipulation;
- **Text analysis** notebook: analysis of most common words, link with other quantities/factors, gathering of relevant insights.
